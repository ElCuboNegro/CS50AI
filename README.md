# CS50AI - L0 - Search
Search is the way an agent reaches a expected state from a initial state.
oh, well, did you expected more than that as a definition? then let's go for that.

First we should know what the heck is an agent, then what is a state... 
and finally, what is a problem. yep, we will go deep into the rabbit hole

## What the fuck is an Agent?
Well, an agent is a piece of software that is aware of it's context, so it's capable
of taking decisions about how to interact with it's environment and has a desired state (which it tries to reach).

### What the fuck an agent can do?
It's a brief list.
- Analyze data: AI agents can collect data and use it to perform tasks.
- Make decisions: AI agents can use data to make decisions and choose actions to achieve goals. 
- Learn: AI agents can learn from their experiences and interactions, improving their performance over time. 
- Perform tasks: AI agents can perform a wide range of tasks, including answering questions, resolving issues, and automating processes. 
- Interact with the environment: AI agents can interact with their environment.
  
Then, more or less, an Intelligent agent is something that behave in this particular way:

## What the fuck is a state?
A state is a configuration of an agent in (or and?) its environment. For example, in a 15 puzzle, a state is any one way that all the numbers are arranged on the board.
### And what is a configuration? 
well, let's say it's the way the things are (the number of things, the positions of all the things inside the group and all the properties of the objects inside the group) in a particular moment. if at least one of the properties, one of the positions or the number of things changes, this is other "configuration".
