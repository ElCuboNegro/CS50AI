# CS50AI - L0 - Search
Search is the way an agent reaches a expected state from a initial state.
oh, well, did you expected more than that as a definition? then let's go for that.

First we should know what the heck is an agent, then what is a state... 
and finally, what is a problem. yep, we will go deep into the rabbit hole

## What the fuck is an Agent?
Well, an agent is a piece of software that is aware of it's context, so it's capable
of taking decisions about how to interact with it's environment and has a desired state (which it tries to reach).

### What the fuck an agent can do?
It's a brief list.
- Analyze data: AI agents can collect data and use it to perform tasks.
- Make decisions: AI agents can use data to make decisions and choose actions to achieve goals. 
- Learn: AI agents can learn from their experiences and interactions, improving their performance over time. 
- Perform tasks: AI agents can perform a wide range of tasks, including answering questions, resolving issues, and automating processes. 
- Interact with the environment: AI agents can interact with their environment.
  
Then, more or less, an Intelligent agent is something that behave in this particular way:

## What the fuck is a state?
A state is a configuration of an agent in (or and?) its environment. For example, in a 15 puzzle, a state is any one way that all the numbers are arranged on the board. 

It is essentially the set of conditions or values that define the systemâ€™s or agent's current configuration and status.

### And what is a configuration? 
well, let's say it's the way the things are (the number of things, the positions of all the things inside the group and all the properties of the objects inside the group) in a particular moment. 

A configurtion can include:

- Internal attributes: The agent's memory, data, or variables that define its current situation.
- External environment conditions: Information about the environment in which the agent operates (e.g., sensor readings, external events).
- Agent's position or situation: Where the agent is in relation to its task or goal (e.g., location in a map, current progress in a process).

### Ahm... and an initial state?
Is the state from which the search algorithm starts. In a navigator app, that would be the current location, or in a maze, the position where you start.
so, you start from a initial state, and then you perform an action. that action modified the system configuration, so you are in a new state. Congratulations!

## What is an action?
