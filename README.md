Hello! If you are here, perhaps you are looking for the lectures notes, or for "how to solve" each exercise. 
This repo is not intended for that. It's purpose is to keep open all the notes, thoughts, and solutions for every single class and exercise.

For each one, I will keep a complete branch, so, if you are looking for anything specific, just look at the branches.
Good luck.

J.
